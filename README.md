# UserFinder Project Completion ðŸš€

I successfully set up and ran the [UserFinder](https://github.com/mishakorzik/UserFinder) project by [mishakorzik](https://github.com/mishakorzik). UserFinder is an open-source intelligence (OSINT) tool that helps locate user profiles across various social media platforms.

### Steps I Took:
1. Updated and upgraded system packages.
2. Installed necessary dependencies (`git`, `curl`, `jq`).
3. Cloned the repository.
4. Ran the tool and verified its functionality.

### Screenshots:
Here's a quick look at my setup and the tool in action!

### Reflections:
This project was a great introduction to OSINT tools and automated username searching across social platforms. I enjoyed configuring and running it and look forward to exploring more projects like this!
